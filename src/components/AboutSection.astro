    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Hi, I&apos;m Lee!</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-2 mb-2">
      I'm a principal-level solutions architect, technical consultant, and full-stack developer. I'm glad you're here!
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-2 mb-2">
      Over the last two decades, Iâ€™ve built software for startups, Fortune 500s, and everything in between. I look for patterns, ask the right questions, and bring clarity to messy problems.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-2 mb-2">
      Whether it's presales, DevRel, or enterprise strategy, I help teams move <span class="text-green-600 font-bold">faster</span>, make <span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">smarter</span> choices, and ship with confidence.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-2 mb-2">
      Current stack? My work centers on React, building AI-driven workflows, headless CMS setups, and serverless systems. I run <span class="text-yellow-600 font-bold">Release Mode LLC</span>, a firm focused on modernization, automation, and scale.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-2 mb-2">
      I'm also building <span class="text-blue-600 font-bold">Full Stack Drip</span>, a video, podcast, and social media brand that explores tech, software, culture, and the chaos of work life in 2025.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-2 mb-2">
      So reach out! <span class="text-red-600 font-bold">Connect with me</span> on LinkedIn, <span class="text-orange-600 font-bold">follow me</span> on Bluesky or Youtube, or <span class="text-purple-600 font-bold">schedule a Zoom call</span> through my calendar link. I'm here to help, collaborate, or just talk tech!
